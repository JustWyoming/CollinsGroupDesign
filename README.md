==================

First time with responsive grid and css site design

Learning coding.  Making a site with fluid grids and java slider. Having an initial problem where nested Nav displays below the slider in mobile view.

Would like to know how to make the nav one menu, with roll out drop downs for mobile, that don't hide themselves below the slider.
