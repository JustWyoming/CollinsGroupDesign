CollinsGroupDesign - New Site Design
==================

### new developer - First time experimenting with a responsive grid and css site layout.

Using the DMXZone Nivo3 Slider and having a problem where nested Nav menu's display below the slider when the browser is sized for mobile.

I would really appreciate suggestions for how to make the entire nav (nested menus and main menus) one menu, with roll out drop downs for mobile view that don't hide themselves below the slider.
